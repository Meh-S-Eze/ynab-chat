        - "components/: Vue components"
        - "App.vue: Root Vue component"
        - "main.js: Application entry point"
        - "config.json: Application configuration"

file_naming:
  conventions:
    - "Use lowercase for all files and directories"
    - "Use hyphens (-) to separate words in filenames"
    - "Vue components should use PascalCase .vue extension"
    - "Configuration files should use appropriate extensions (.json, .yaml, etc.)"

component_organization:
  structure:
    - "Group related components in subdirectories"
    - "Keep component names descriptive and specific"
    - "Use index.js files for directory exports"

  required:
    - "package.json: Project dependencies and scripts"
    - "webpack.config.js: Build configuration"
    - ".env: Environment variables (gitignored)"
    - ".gitignore: Git ignore patterns"
    - ".editorconfig: Editor configuration"
    - "README.md: Project documentation"

    - "Lock files (package-lock.json) must be committed"
