component_hierarchy:
  root:
    name: "App.vue"
    purpose: "Root application component"
    responsibilities:
      - "OAuth authentication handling"
      - "Global state management"
      - "Main routing logic"
    children:
      - name: "Nav"
        purpose: "Navigation component"
        data_needs: ["authentication status"]
      
      - name: "Budgets"
        purpose: "Budget selection and display"
        data_needs: ["budgets list"]
        api_dependencies: ["/budgets"]
      
      - name: "Transactions"
        purpose: "Transaction management"
        data_needs: ["transactions list", "budget_id"]
        api_dependencies: ["/budgets/{budget_id}/transactions"]

data_flow:
  patterns:
    - name: "Top-down props"
      usage: "Pass data from parent to child components"
      example: "Budget ID flowing from App to Transactions"
    
    - name: "Events up"
      usage: "Child components notify parents of changes"
      example: "Transaction component emits update events"
    
    - name: "Vuex store"
      usage: "Global state management"
      stored_data:
        - "Authentication state"
        - "Current budget"
        - "User preferences"

state_management:
  local_state:
    - component: "App"
      manages:
        - "Current route"
        - "Authentication token"
        - "Loading states"
    
    - component: "Budgets"
      manages:
        - "Selected budget"
        - "Budget list cache"
    
    - component: "Transactions"
      manages:
        - "Transaction filters"
        - "Pagination state"
        - "Sort order"

api_integration:
  data_fetching:
    pattern: "Fetch then render"
    implementation:
      - "Show loading state"
      - "Make API request"
      - "Handle errors"
      - "Update local state"
      - "Render updated UI"
  
  caching_strategy:
    - "Cache budget list in memory"
    - "Cache transactions per budget"
    - "Implement cache invalidation"
    - "Handle stale data scenarios"

reactivity:
  patterns:
    - name: "Computed properties"
      usage: "Derived data calculations"
      examples:
        - "Filtered transactions"
        - "Budget summaries"
        - "Category totals"
    
    - name: "Watchers"
      usage: "Side effects on data changes"
      examples:
        - "Update URL on budget change"
        - "Refresh data on filter change"
        - "Save preferences on change"

error_handling:
  ui_feedback:
    - "Loading indicators"
    - "Error messages"
    - "Empty states"
    - "Retry mechanisms"
  
  error_boundaries:
    - "Component level error catching"
    - "Global error handler"
    - "Fallback UI components"

performance:
  optimizations:
    - "Lazy loading routes"
    - "Virtual scrolling for long lists"
    - "Debounced search inputs"
    - "Cached API responses"
    - "Optimistic UI updates"

accessibility:
  requirements:
    - "ARIA labels"
    - "Keyboard navigation"
    - "Screen reader support"
    - "Color contrast compliance"
    - "Focus management"

responsive_design:
  breakpoints:
    mobile: "< 768px"
    tablet: "768px - 1024px"
    desktop: "> 1024px"
  
  strategies:
    - "Mobile-first approach"
    - "Flexible grid layouts"
    - "Responsive typography"
    - "Adaptive content"

best_practices:
  - "Keep components focused and single-purpose"
  - "Implement proper loading states"
  - "Handle all error cases"
  - "Cache API responses appropriately"
  - "Use computed properties for derived data"
  - "Implement proper accessibility features"
  - "Follow responsive design principles"
